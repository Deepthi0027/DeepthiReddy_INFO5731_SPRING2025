2,I enjoyed the first two seasons of Designated Survivor it was entertaining and kept your interest  If your a 24 fan you will enjoy the first two seasons it s basically if Jack Bauer became president  The third season it fell apart with the removal of some of the cast with no explanation  They also added lots of unnecessary cussing that did not fit the vibe it totally changed the mood of the show ,positive
3,Season One and Two were fantastic  Interesting  gripping  great cast and production  I couldn t wait for the next episode  After Netflix took over Season Three  I stopped watching after about one third of the episodes  Season Three is obsessed and strategized with misguided identity politics   politically correct  content  and crass language  The screenplays for Season Three are amateurish and nowhere match those of Season One and Two  Strange  when Netflix produces  things get sleazy ,neutral
4,I really liked  Designated Survivor  for the first two seasons  gave them a rating of 9  and was happy when they announced that Netfkix was going to do a thrid season  but not only is this season dull  do they have new script writers   but they have added crude language and graphic sex which is disappointing  The story line of Kirkman running for president is done in a lousy way  The new characters are obnoxious straight down the line even though the actors who play them are  for the most part  decent actors  Overacted and with the feeling that everyone except Sutherland are just phoning it in  This is turning me off pretty quickly  How could Netflix ruin what was a decent series  Those of us who were watching it most likely didn t watch a lot of  House of Cards  and that is not what we want ,neutral
5,I ve liked this show even though it s a little liberal for me  I was excited Netflix picked it up after being cancelled  Why did Netflix have to add the cursing  The show was fine without it  Language doesn t add anything to the quality of the show  I know everyone thinks it makes it more realistic but I disagree  It just isn t needed ,positive
6,This show is one of my favourite Netflix Originals  It kind of combines House of Cards  2013  with 24  2001  really well with it being half political drama and half action thriller  All of the main cast play such amazing  likeable but flawed characters  Season One is by far the best because you just had no idea where it was going  season two kept the suspense with a different story every week but still had long running stories  Season three however wasn t that good  It had some good moments but it just felt like a very different show ,neutral
7,Started off brilliant  season one is fantastic  Season 2 is just as good  But the whole tone of the show changes in season 3  ruined it for me  As it was only ten episodes  I stuck with it  it just got worse  It was like some of the characters personalities completely changed in the third season  What s great about seasons one and two  is it s just as it would be if Jack Bauer ever became president  loved that  The acting is great in the first two seasons  and the storylines are great  quickest I ve ever got through so many episodes of any show So to sum up  definitely worth a watch  but probably best to forget they ever made a third season ,neutral
8,This show  which I stumbled upon when trying to find something to watch  grabbed me right off the cuff  Full of twists and turns  incredible storylines and great actors  I am sold  From terrorists  to conspiracies  to family and finally the incredible conflicts going on within the country  Watch it  Now ,neutral
9,I ve just binge watched it up to the end of Episode 18  The initial premise is interesting  whether or not it s actually based in reality  You always need to grant some leeway with  initial premises   especially these days  I stopped watching 24 after the second season because I found it too infantile and silly  I did watch The West Wing through to the end  This is a sort of 24 meets The West Wing  The show lets itself down with too many loving gazes between the President and his wife  does she have any flaws at all    some terribly clunky lines and worst of all  the relentless US Patriot  buzz word laden speeches   The American people deserve       Rebuilding our amazing nation       Rebuilding our fantastic Government   There s no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government  There s no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics  The various  third rails  of US politics are briefly mentioned  It is a show about a fantasy America and a fantasy American Government  It s the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond  Having said all that  it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging  The only caveat is   if you find  true blue  Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism  too much to bear  you re going to struggle with this show  But it s probably worth bearing with  all in all  There are far  far worse shows on TV ,neutral
10,I wish Tom Kirkman were our actual president  Great characters and keeps you going ,neutral
11,Nothing is added by Netflix s inclusion of profanity for this new season  Just because you Can doesn t mean you Should  A famous adage that applies especially when it affects the tenor and tone of a show that  survived  without  It is actually distracting and takes away from the enjoyment of the show ,neutral
12,The pilot episode was intriguing but as Designated Survivor  just watched episode 5  goes on it s really hitting it  s stride  Kiefer s acting is compelling and all of the characters are beginning to get fleshed out as the story begins to come together  The idea of an every man becoming President is interesting as he copes with the difficult choices he has to make  and the effects his new job have on him and his family  Actually showing the incredible toll that making life and death decisions a decent man who is president has to make  is so enlightening and Kiefer is masterful at portraying the pathos as well as the joy  Adding the conspiracy suspense to the mix makes it edge of your seat viewing  This is the first new show in a long time that I actually look forward to watching ,neutral
13,Season 1 and 2  Designated Surivor introduced plots and narratives that were a mixed bag  Some were enthralling and alluded to bigger plots  but ultimately led to nowhere  or went out with a whimper  Other elements led to unforseen twists which spiced up the story Without any spoilers  there were plots that I had hoped were expanded upon or developed further  rather than being conviniently wrapped up by the end of the episode with little consequence  However  with that being said  there were little details that turned into something big and added a bit of danger to the story Maybe this was due to budget constraints or ABC oversight from preventing the series from becoming too dark  because I don t believe that the writers who brainstormed some pretty solid ideas  wanted those ideas to pan out the way they did Season 3  is helmed purely by Netflix  and it shows  That s not necessarily a good nor bad thing  The season still suffers from the  long build and anti climatic whimper  the first two seasons had  Some story points just wrapped up too quickly after they build up they were given  In essence  great concepts but poor execution still plagues this series The language is a bit vulgar and gratuitous  hitting me like a freight train roaring down a mountain  The showed laid it on heavy  probably wanting to hammer home that Designated Survivor is now Netflix s new dark gritty baby and potential heir to House of Cards  The series practically broke the fourth wall when a certain character swore  The language was toned down later on in the season  and the writers reserved its usage to add a punchier effect Another thing I noticed with Season 3 is how slanted the politics were  compared to the previous seasons  ABC  according to them  tries to be politically unbiased  and so the first two seasons attempted to reflect that  The villains were based on groups in the real world  but it was far removed enough that there was no direct link  The politics espoused by the President s speech were distinctly centrist  But in Season 3  there is a left wing slant no matter how hard the series tries to tell me that it is centrist  This is mostly a result of the season having a distinct tone of identity politics that just feels off  That being said  the left wing politcs is nowhere near  West Wing  levels  so the politically right leaning shouldn t be turned off by it  I m also certain West Wing never bothered with identity politics either  It was a show from a different time   The series still does take potshots at both ends of the political spectrum  just not as strongly as the first two  and also notes that not all groups are monolithic  which is nice  However  there is a definite Left wing slant in Season 3  Right wing extremist groups are mentioned a lot  but not a peep about left wing extremists Season 3 also takes a lot cues from what s happening in the world right now  I can t quite articulate it  but there s something jarring about watching the series and instantly being reminded about a certain rally that happened in the real world not too long ago  I m don t find it off putting per se  but I do find it jarring and that it would make the season feel dated in later years to come  Not to mention  these references are just that  references  They don t really add anything to the story  or the over arching plot This is an issue that I m noticing more in Season 3  than the first two seasons  There are character arcs that serve no other purpose than just padding out the run time and attempting to make them more than just cardboard cutouts Which brings me to my next point  there are a few characters missing  There is a convinient narrative explanation for this  but when you think about the characters that are affected by it  it doesn t make sense as to why they re absent  I am aware that the actors and actresses may not be available for whatever reason and had to have been replaced  but there are a lot of turnovers  and some of the replacements don t feel as valuable or as likeable as their predecessors Lastly  the music  I usually don t coment on music  but some of the selections used at the end of certain episodes felt off  considering the subject matter they finished with  The tunes were a bit too spirited for a moment that should be tragic and horrifying I know my review has largely been negative so far  but I ll list the good   Kirkman s character development and interaction with family  Emily s development  New Chief of Staff Mars  He s a new addition but I really enjoyed his arc  Arguably the best part of Season 3   The Campaign Manager  This character is a barrel of excitement   A different portrayal of the CIA  In most media  the CIA is always portrayed as this overly powerful organisation that skirts the rules whenever it chooses  Here they re shown as an Agency with not enough domestic resources  I don t know how representative that is of real life  but it s a refreshing change   Dr Eli  he s a geneticist  Great character  The scientific matieral in season 3 is surprisingly accurate  albeit broad  I guess they don t want to be caught out by the details  but it s nice to see things that are more authentic at first glance ,neutral
14,This show started off REALLY well  I was right into after Season 1  Season 2 fell apart  after awhile I realized that if I wasn t watching episodes back to back there would be at least a week in between shows so the randomness might not be as blatant  like characters just vanishing off the show with sometimes not even a mention  The formula of crisis is introduced  crisis is explained as how it will hurt the presidents reputation  crisis is averted with some kind of personal sacrifice from the president  Rinse and repeat after every episode I stopped about 3 4 of the way through season 2  I just can t do it anymore with this show  I don t remember seeing a show tank as fast as this one  Super disappointing with where this show went  I think if you are looking for a political drama The West Wing would be better ,neutral
15,If you can get past an enemy being able to blow up the Capitol during the State of the Union  leaving only a single representative and the Secretary of HUD as designated survivors  then this is a fantastic show  The challenges would be almost insurmountable  and Kiefer Sutherland is awesome  His character is growing every week  His wife is a strong woman  an attorney  and will obviously make a great First Lady  His oldest son has issues  so it will be interesting to see how that all falls out  There also seems to be some mystery surrounding one survivor of the bombing  as well as the actions of state governors in the wake of the disaster  To me  this is reminiscent of The West Wing  at least so far  I highly recommend this ,neutral
16,It really is an older Jack Bauer as the President  He doesn t need a gun anymore  but his moral compass is just as strong  His character is learning what it means to have power and manipulate people to do what is needed  Its only been two days since the incident  so I guess its to early to have any answers  However I think an inside job has to be the obvious solution for how it happened  which will probably be addressed in the future  So far I love this show and recommend everyone to watch it on Netflicks ,neutral
17,The first episode was of a high quality  but after a couple of episodes this show becomes 3 shows  A  House Of Cards  with a  too good  always makes politically correct decisions  president  He is just not interesting  I wish he w s evil  A  Homeland  woman who tries to save the world on her own  She s also not interesting and the  action scenes  with her are like the A team or mcgyver  just amateurish   just like the black screened beeping Hollywood computers they use  with awful animations   Then there is the wife and kids and it s just too sweet  The  designated survivor  thing is a very interesting story  I wish there were flash back episodes  why the attackers did it  How was the situation before  Also make Keifer suck  Let him make wrong decisions  be a lousy husband that secretly enjoys all this new power ,positive
18,If ever you needed an example of why TV shows work best as serials  look no further than  Designated Survivor   Sworn in as president following a terrorist attack  Kiefer Sutherland s character has to face a new crisis on every episode  As the story progresses  it becomes clear that there s more than meets the eye In addition to Sutherland  there s fine support from Natascha McElhone  The Truman Show   Kal Penn  Harold   Kumar  and others  I recommend it ,neutral
19,8 episodes in and I m really enjoying this  It s basically 24 but with Kroger Sutherland spending more time sat down  think things through and being political loving while other younger or more vicious characters do all the running around and provide the action ,neutral
20,This could have been an excellent series if they hadn t have decided they were there to be a shill for a political party instead of entertainment Especially when a lot of the political stuff was full of dishonest claims and  facts  they used to push an ideological agenda ,neutral
21,Intelligent  dramatic dialogue  engaging and endearing characters  most episodes resolve positively and wonderful messages throughout  One of the best series I ve watched in years  Sutherland s best role so far  Hats off ,neutral
22,Overall like first two seasons very well  was one of the few shows clean enough to be considered a family show  One episode in after Netflix took over and already potty mouth  The f word and gd word have added nothing constructive to the show  just now won t be watching any more due to the offensive language  Thanks for ruinous a good show Netflix ,neutral
23,At the beginning it was such an amazing show but it gets worse every season  especially season 3 when netflix picked it up ,neutral
24,Designated Survivor is the only new show of the season I have any interest in watching  The show concerns a terror attack during the State of the Union address that wipes out the President  Vice President  the House  the Senate and other high level government officials who are in the Capitol Building at that time When there is a large assembly of President  VP  House  Senate  etc  one person is chosen to stay behind in the event of just such a thing occurring  After the show premiered  I did see a news report about this  and apparently it is true  Makes sense The designated survivor in this case is the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development  Tom Kirkman  Kiefer Sutherland   He is 11th in line of succession  but he moves up to the top after the attack  No one finds him qualified  and in fact  some people refuse to follow his orders  However  Kirkman is stronger than they know  even if he is more deliberate in making decisions  He is also a caring individual who wants to live up to his responsibilities and serve the people It s a tough adjustment for a married man with two children who previously had a very different job  His first order of business is finding out who attacked the U S  as the Joint Chiefs of Staff are eager to go after whom they believe is responsible This may be a problem a year show  where it takes an entire season for one situation to be resolved  and the second season begins with another problem  So far the investigation of what happened is very exciting and pointing to the involvement of one Senator who was conspicuously absent at the time of the explosion The cast is very good  including a nearly unrecognizable Virginia Mattson  whose agenda seems hidden  Ashley Zukerman as the questionable Senator  Kal Penn  Natascha McElhone  and many others  all of whom are top notch But there s no question that the quiet strength Kiefer Sutherland brings to the character of Kirkman carries the show  He s excellent as a man who had greatness thrust upon him as he deals with a few supporters  a lot of enemies  and his family Very good series  Hope it lasts ,neutral

49,Season One and Two were fantastic  Interesting  gripping  great cast and production  I couldn t wait for the next episode  After Netflix took over Season Three  I stopped watching after about one third of the episodes  Season Three is obsessed and strategized with misguided identity politics   politically correct  content  and crass language  The screenplays for Season Three are amateurish and nowhere match those of Season One and Two  Strange  when Netflix produces  things get sleazy ,neutral
50,I really liked  Designated Survivor  for the first two seasons  gave them a rating of 9  and was happy when they announced that Netfkix was going to do a thrid season  but not only is this season dull  do they have new script writers   but they have added crude language and graphic sex which is disappointing  The story line of Kirkman running for president is done in a lousy way  The new characters are obnoxious straight down the line even though the actors who play them are  for the most part  decent actors  Overacted and with the feeling that everyone except Sutherland are just phoning it in  This is turning me off pretty quickly  How could Netflix ruin what was a decent series  Those of us who were watching it most likely didn t watch a lot of  House of Cards  and that is not what we want ,neutral
51,I ve liked this show even though it s a little liberal for me  I was excited Netflix picked it up after being cancelled  Why did Netflix have to add the cursing  The show was fine without it  Language doesn t add anything to the quality of the show  I know everyone thinks it makes it more realistic but I disagree  It just isn t needed ,neutral
52,This show is one of my favourite Netflix Originals  It kind of combines House of Cards  2013  with 24  2001  really well with it being half political drama and half action thriller  All of the main cast play such amazing  likeable but flawed characters  Season One is by far the best because you just had no idea where it was going  season two kept the suspense with a different story every week but still had long running stories  Season three however wasn t that good  It had some good moments but it just felt like a very different show ,neutral
53,Started off brilliant  season one is fantastic  Season 2 is just as good  But the whole tone of the show changes in season 3  ruined it for me  As it was only ten episodes  I stuck with it  it just got worse  It was like some of the characters personalities completely changed in the third season  What s great about seasons one and two  is it s just as it would be if Jack Bauer ever became president  loved that  The acting is great in the first two seasons  and the storylines are great  quickest I ve ever got through so many episodes of any show So to sum up  definitely worth a watch  but probably best to forget they ever made a third season ,neutral
54,This show  which I stumbled upon when trying to find something to watch  grabbed me right off the cuff  Full of twists and turns  incredible storylines and great actors  I am sold  From terrorists  to conspiracies  to family and finally the incredible conflicts going on within the country  Watch it  Now ,neutral
55,I ve just binge watched it up to the end of Episode 18  The initial premise is interesting  whether or not it s actually based in reality  You always need to grant some leeway with  initial premises   especially these days  I stopped watching 24 after the second season because I found it too infantile and silly  I did watch The West Wing through to the end  This is a sort of 24 meets The West Wing  The show lets itself down with too many loving gazes between the President and his wife  does she have any flaws at all    some terribly clunky lines and worst of all  the relentless US Patriot  buzz word laden speeches   The American people deserve       Rebuilding our amazing nation       Rebuilding our fantastic Government   There s no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government  There s no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics  The various  third rails  of US politics are briefly mentioned  It is a show about a fantasy America and a fantasy American Government  It s the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond  Having said all that  it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging  The only caveat is   if you find  true blue  Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism  too much to bear  you re going to struggle with this show  But it s probably worth bearing with  all in all  There are far  far worse shows on TV ,neutral
56,I wish Tom Kirkman were our actual president  Great characters and keeps you going ,neutral
57,Nothing is added by Netflix s inclusion of profanity for this new season  Just because you Can doesn t mean you Should  A famous adage that applies especially when it affects the tenor and tone of a show that  survived  without  It is actually distracting and takes away from the enjoyment of the show ,neutral
58,The pilot episode was intriguing but as Designated Survivor  just watched episode 5  goes on it s really hitting it  s stride  Kiefer s acting is compelling and all of the characters are beginning to get fleshed out as the story begins to come together  The idea of an every man becoming President is interesting as he copes with the difficult choices he has to make  and the effects his new job have on him and his family  Actually showing the incredible toll that making life and death decisions a decent man who is president has to make  is so enlightening and Kiefer is masterful at portraying the pathos as well as the joy  Adding the conspiracy suspense to the mix makes it edge of your seat viewing  This is the first new show in a long time that I actually look forward to watching ,positive
59,Season 1 and 2  Designated Surivor introduced plots and narratives that were a mixed bag  Some were enthralling and alluded to bigger plots  but ultimately led to nowhere  or went out with a whimper  Other elements led to unforseen twists which spiced up the story Without any spoilers  there were plots that I had hoped were expanded upon or developed further  rather than being conviniently wrapped up by the end of the episode with little consequence  However  with that being said  there were little details that turned into something big and added a bit of danger to the story Maybe this was due to budget constraints or ABC oversight from preventing the series from becoming too dark  because I don t believe that the writers who brainstormed some pretty solid ideas  wanted those ideas to pan out the way they did Season 3  is helmed purely by Netflix  and it shows  That s not necessarily a good nor bad thing  The season still suffers from the  long build and anti climatic whimper  the first two seasons had  Some story points just wrapped up too quickly after they build up they were given  In essence  great concepts but poor execution still plagues this series The language is a bit vulgar and gratuitous  hitting me like a freight train roaring down a mountain  The showed laid it on heavy  probably wanting to hammer home that Designated Survivor is now Netflix s new dark gritty baby and potential heir to House of Cards  The series practically broke the fourth wall when a certain character swore  The language was toned down later on in the season  and the writers reserved its usage to add a punchier effect Another thing I noticed with Season 3 is how slanted the politics were  compared to the previous seasons  ABC  according to them  tries to be politically unbiased  and so the first two seasons attempted to reflect that  The villains were based on groups in the real world  but it was far removed enough that there was no direct link  The politics espoused by the President s speech were distinctly centrist  But in Season 3  there is a left wing slant no matter how hard the series tries to tell me that it is centrist  This is mostly a result of the season having a distinct tone of identity politics that just feels off  That being said  the left wing politcs is nowhere near  West Wing  levels  so the politically right leaning shouldn t be turned off by it  I m also certain West Wing never bothered with identity politics either  It was a show from a different time   The series still does take potshots at both ends of the political spectrum  just not as strongly as the first two  and also notes that not all groups are monolithic  which is nice  However  there is a definite Left wing slant in Season 3  Right wing extremist groups are mentioned a lot  but not a peep about left wing extremists Season 3 also takes a lot cues from what s happening in the world right now  I can t quite articulate it  but there s something jarring about watching the series and instantly being reminded about a certain rally that happened in the real world not too long ago  I m don t find it off putting per se  but I do find it jarring and that it would make the season feel dated in later years to come  Not to mention  these references are just that  references  They don t really add anything to the story  or the over arching plot This is an issue that I m noticing more in Season 3  than the first two seasons  There are character arcs that serve no other purpose than just padding out the run time and attempting to make them more than just cardboard cutouts Which brings me to my next point  there are a few characters missing  There is a convinient narrative explanation for this  but when you think about the characters that are affected by it  it doesn t make sense as to why they re absent  I am aware that the actors and actresses may not be available for whatever reason and had to have been replaced  but there are a lot of turnovers  and some of the replacements don t feel as valuable or as likeable as their predecessors Lastly  the music  I usually don t coment on music  but some of the selections used at the end of certain episodes felt off  considering the subject matter they finished with  The tunes were a bit too spirited for a moment that should be tragic and horrifying I know my review has largely been negative so far  but I ll list the good   Kirkman s character development and interaction with family  Emily s development  New Chief of Staff Mars  He s a new addition but I really enjoyed his arc  Arguably the best part of Season 3   The Campaign Manager  This character is a barrel of excitement   A different portrayal of the CIA  In most media  the CIA is always portrayed as this overly powerful organisation that skirts the rules whenever it chooses  Here they re shown as an Agency with not enough domestic resources  I don t know how representative that is of real life  but it s a refreshing change   Dr Eli  he s a geneticist  Great character  The scientific matieral in season 3 is surprisingly accurate  albeit broad  I guess they don t want to be caught out by the details  but it s nice to see things that are more authentic at first glance ,neutral
60,This show started off REALLY well  I was right into after Season 1  Season 2 fell apart  after awhile I realized that if I wasn t watching episodes back to back there would be at least a week in between shows so the randomness might not be as blatant  like characters just vanishing off the show with sometimes not even a mention  The formula of crisis is introduced  crisis is explained as how it will hurt the presidents reputation  crisis is averted with some kind of personal sacrifice from the president  Rinse and repeat after every episode I stopped about 3 4 of the way through season 2  I just can t do it anymore with this show  I don t remember seeing a show tank as fast as this one  Super disappointing with where this show went  I think if you are looking for a political drama The West Wing would be better ,neutral
61,If you can get past an enemy being able to blow up the Capitol during the State of the Union  leaving only a single representative and the Secretary of HUD as designated survivors  then this is a fantastic show  The challenges would be almost insurmountable  and Kiefer Sutherland is awesome  His character is growing every week  His wife is a strong woman  an attorney  and will obviously make a great First Lady  His oldest son has issues  so it will be interesting to see how that all falls out  There also seems to be some mystery surrounding one survivor of the bombing  as well as the actions of state governors in the wake of the disaster  To me  this is reminiscent of The West Wing  at least so far  I highly recommend this ,neutral
62,It really is an older Jack Bauer as the President  He doesn t need a gun anymore  but his moral compass is just as strong  His character is learning what it means to have power and manipulate people to do what is needed  Its only been two days since the incident  so I guess its to early to have any answers  However I think an inside job has to be the obvious solution for how it happened  which will probably be addressed in the future  So far I love this show and recommend everyone to watch it on Netflicks ,neutral
63,The first episode was of a high quality  but after a couple of episodes this show becomes 3 shows  A  House Of Cards  with a  too good  always makes politically correct decisions  president  He is just not interesting  I wish he w s evil  A  Homeland  woman who tries to save the world on her own  She s also not interesting and the  action scenes  with her are like the A team or mcgyver  just amateurish   just like the black screened beeping Hollywood computers they use  with awful animations   Then there is the wife and kids and it s just too sweet  The  designated survivor  thing is a very interesting story  I wish there were flash back episodes  why the attackers did it  How was the situation before  Also make Keifer suck  Let him make wrong decisions  be a lousy husband that secretly enjoys all this new power ,neutral
64,If ever you needed an example of why TV shows work best as serials  look no further than  Designated Survivor   Sworn in as president following a terrorist attack  Kiefer Sutherland s character has to face a new crisis on every episode  As the story progresses  it becomes clear that there s more than meets the eye In addition to Sutherland  there s fine support from Natascha McElhone  The Truman Show   Kal Penn  Harold   Kumar  and others  I recommend it ,neutral
65,8 episodes in and I m really enjoying this  It s basically 24 but with Kroger Sutherland spending more time sat down  think things through and being political loving while other younger or more vicious characters do all the running around and provide the action ,neutral
66,This could have been an excellent series if they hadn t have decided they were there to be a shill for a political party instead of entertainment Especially when a lot of the political stuff was full of dishonest claims and  facts  they used to push an ideological agenda ,neutral
67,Intelligent  dramatic dialogue  engaging and endearing characters  most episodes resolve positively and wonderful messages throughout  One of the best series I ve watched in years  Sutherland s best role so far  Hats off ,neutral
68,Overall like first two seasons very well  was one of the few shows clean enough to be considered a family show  One episode in after Netflix took over and already potty mouth  The f word and gd word have added nothing constructive to the show  just now won t be watching any more due to the offensive language  Thanks for ruinous a good show Netflix ,neutral

93,Designated Survivor is the only new show of the season I have any interest in watching  The show concerns a terror attack during the State of the Union address that wipes out the President  Vice President  the House  the Senate and other high level government officials who are in the Capitol Building at that time When there is a large assembly of President  VP  House  Senate  etc  one person is chosen to stay behind in the event of just such a thing occurring  After the show premiered  I did see a news report about this  and apparently it is true  Makes sense The designated survivor in this case is the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development  Tom Kirkman  Kiefer Sutherland   He is 11th in line of succession  but he moves up to the top after the attack  No one finds him qualified  and in fact  some people refuse to follow his orders  However  Kirkman is stronger than they know  even if he is more deliberate in making decisions  He is also a caring individual who wants to live up to his responsibilities and serve the people It s a tough adjustment for a married man with two children who previously had a very different job  His first order of business is finding out who attacked the U S  as the Joint Chiefs of Staff are eager to go after whom they believe is responsible This may be a problem a year show  where it takes an entire season for one situation to be resolved  and the second season begins with another problem  So far the investigation of what happened is very exciting and pointing to the involvement of one Senator who was conspicuously absent at the time of the explosion The cast is very good  including a nearly unrecognizable Virginia Mattson  whose agenda seems hidden  Ashley Zukerman as the questionable Senator  Kal Penn  Natascha McElhone  and many others  all of whom are top notch But there s no question that the quiet strength Kiefer Sutherland brings to the character of Kirkman carries the show  He s excellent as a man who had greatness thrust upon him as he deals with a few supporters  a lot of enemies  and his family Very good series  Hope it lasts ,neutral
94,I enjoyed the first two seasons of Designated Survivor it was entertaining and kept your interest  If your a 24 fan you will enjoy the first two seasons it s basically if Jack Bauer became president  The third season it fell apart with the removal of some of the cast with no explanation  They also added lots of unnecessary cussing that did not fit the vibe it totally changed the mood of the show ,neutral
95,Season One and Two were fantastic  Interesting  gripping  great cast and production  I couldn t wait for the next episode  After Netflix took over Season Three  I stopped watching after about one third of the episodes  Season Three is obsessed and strategized with misguided identity politics   politically correct  content  and crass language  The screenplays for Season Three are amateurish and nowhere match those of Season One and Two  Strange  when Netflix produces  things get sleazy ,neutral
96,I really liked  Designated Survivor  for the first two seasons  gave them a rating of 9  and was happy when they announced that Netfkix was going to do a thrid season  but not only is this season dull  do they have new script writers   but they have added crude language and graphic sex which is disappointing  The story line of Kirkman running for president is done in a lousy way  The new characters are obnoxious straight down the line even though the actors who play them are  for the most part  decent actors  Overacted and with the feeling that everyone except Sutherland are just phoning it in  This is turning me off pretty quickly  How could Netflix ruin what was a decent series  Those of us who were watching it most likely didn t watch a lot of  House of Cards  and that is not what we want ,positive
97,I ve liked this show even though it s a little liberal for me  I was excited Netflix picked it up after being cancelled  Why did Netflix have to add the cursing  The show was fine without it  Language doesn t add anything to the quality of the show  I know everyone thinks it makes it more realistic but I disagree  It just isn t needed ,neutral
98,This show is one of my favourite Netflix Originals  It kind of combines House of Cards  2013  with 24  2001  really well with it being half political drama and half action thriller  All of the main cast play such amazing  likeable but flawed characters  Season One is by far the best because you just had no idea where it was going  season two kept the suspense with a different story every week but still had long running stories  Season three however wasn t that good  It had some good moments but it just felt like a very different show ,positive
99,Started off brilliant  season one is fantastic  Season 2 is just as good  But the whole tone of the show changes in season 3  ruined it for me  As it was only ten episodes  I stuck with it  it just got worse  It was like some of the characters personalities completely changed in the third season  What s great about seasons one and two  is it s just as it would be if Jack Bauer ever became president  loved that  The acting is great in the first two seasons  and the storylines are great  quickest I ve ever got through so many episodes of any show So to sum up  definitely worth a watch  but probably best to forget they ever made a third season ,neutral
100,This show  which I stumbled upon when trying to find something to watch  grabbed me right off the cuff  Full of twists and turns  incredible storylines and great actors  I am sold  From terrorists  to conspiracies  to family and finally the incredible conflicts going on within the country  Watch it  Now ,neutral

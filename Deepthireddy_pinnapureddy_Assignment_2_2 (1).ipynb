            "[\"I enjoyed the first two seasons of Designated Survivor it was entertaining and kept your interest. If your a 24 fan you will enjoy the first two seasons it's basically if Jack Bauer became president. The third season it fell apart with the removal of some of the cast with no explanation. They also added lots of unnecessary cussing that did not fit the vibe it totally changed the mood of the show.\", 'Season One and Two were fantastic: Interesting, gripping, great cast and production. I couldn\\'t wait for the next episode. After Netflix took over Season Three, I stopped watching after about one-third of the episodes. Season Three is obsessed and strategized with misguided identity politics, \"politically correct\" content, and crass language. The screenplays for Season Three are amateurish and nowhere match those of Season One and Two. Strange, when Netflix produces, things get sleazy.', 'I really liked \"Designated Survivor\" for the first two seasons (gave them a rating of 9) and was happy when they announced that Netfkix was going to do a thrid season, but not only is this season dull (do they have new script writers?) but they have added crude language and graphic sex which is disappointing. The story line of Kirkman running for president is done in a lousy way. The new characters are obnoxious straight down the line even though the actors who play them are, for the most part, decent actors. Overacted and with the feeling that everyone except Sutherland are just phoning it in. This is turning me off pretty quickly. How could Netflix ruin what was a decent series? Those of us who were watching it most likely didn\\'t watch a lot of \"House of Cards\" and that is not what we want.', \"I've liked this show even though it's a little liberal for me. I was excited Netflix picked it up after being cancelled. Why did Netflix have to add the cursing? The show was fine without it. Language doesn't add anything to the quality of the show. I know everyone thinks it makes it more realistic but I disagree. It just isn't needed.\", \"This show is one of my favourite Netflix Originals. It kind of combines House of Cards (2013) with 24 (2001) really well with it being half political drama and half action thriller. All of the main cast play such amazing, likeable but flawed characters. Season One is by far the best because you just had no idea where it was going, season two kept the suspense with a different story every week but still had long running stories. Season three however wasn't that good. It had some good moments but it just felt like a very different show.\"]\n",

There's no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government. There's no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics.

It's the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond. Having said all that, it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging. The only caveat is - if you find \\\"true blue, Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism\\\" too much to bear, you're going to struggle with this show.

I stopped watching 24 after the second season because I found it too infantile and silly. I did watch The West Wing through to the end. This is a sort of 24 meets The West Wing. The show lets itself down with too many loving gazes between the President and his wife (does she have any flaws at all?), some terribly clunky lines and worst of all, the relentless US Patriot, buzz word laden speeches. \\\"The American people deserve...\\\". \\\"Rebuilding our amazing nation...\\\". \\\"Rebuilding our fantastic Government\\\". There's no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government. There's no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics. The various \\\"third rails\\\" of US politics are briefly mentioned. It is a show about a fantasy America and a fantasy American Government. It's the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond. Having said all that, it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging. The only caveat is - if you find \\\"true blue, Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism\\\" too much to bear, you're going to struggle with this show.

There's no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government. There's no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics. The various \\\"third rails\\\" of US politics are briefly mentioned. It is a show about a fantasy America and a fantasy American Government. It's the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond. Having said all that, it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging. The only caveat is - if you find \\\"true blue, Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism\\\" too much to bear, you're going to struggle with this show.

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
